## How to interpret constraints

```Go
type ReadWriter interface { io.Reader; io.Writer }
```

It requires type arguments:

* must satisi

It determines type parameters:

* has a `Read` method
* has a `Write` method


## Type parameters in methods could even be `_` if they are not used in the method declaration

## Try to use aliases of instantiated types

Or embed them, to make the methods declared for them available.

This is actually the same as general value types, nothing special.

```Go
package main

type Foo[T any] []T

func (f Foo[T]) M() {}

type (
	P = Foo[int]
	Q Foo[int]
	R struct{
		Foo[int]
	}
)

func main() {
	var x P
	x.M() // okay
	
	var y Q
	y.M() // y.M undefined (type Q has no field or method M)
	
	var r R
	r.M() // okay
}
```
