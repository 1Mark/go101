* ~T is called underlying term

* type argument inference needs more detailed explainations.

* Implementation restriction: A compiler need not report an error if an operand's type is a type parameter with an empty type set. Functions with such type parameters cannot be instantiated; any attempt will lead to an error at the instantiation site. 

* example: how to define an expected constraint?
  * some achievable, some are not.  

* An example show the difference of using ordinary interface and generic constraint

* What does this constraint mean?
  interface {
  	M1()
  	M2() error
  	I
  	int | bool
  }
