https://talks.osinet.fr/generics-en.slide#22



For a given type parameter T:

    declare a T variable
    assign a T value to a T variable
    pass or receive a T value to/from a function/method
    take address of a T variable
    convert a T value to interface{} (aka any) or T
    assert an interface value x to x.(T)
    define a type switch clause as case T:
    define composite types using T
    pass T to some builtins, especially new and make



## Could not declare an unnamed generic type
